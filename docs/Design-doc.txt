Collect the minimum metadata and let user optionally protect their Wrapped with a password. Keep it emotional, not technical.

Layout (single column)

Back button (top-left icon) — returns to Landing

Title (large): “Create your Wrapped”

Subtext: “A private web keepsake for your partner. No account required.”

Form card:

Input: Your name (placeholder: “Your name…”) — optional but encouraged

Password mismatch → “Passwords don’t match.”

Network save: as soon as user taps Start Creating, create Wrapped on backend and navigate to Editor with a tiny toast “Saving…” then success animation.

If network fails: show a persistent banner "Couldn't create Wrapped. Try again." with Retry button.

Animations & transitions

Toggle ON: slide-down password field with cross-fade.

On successful create: small confetti burst on the CTA and transition to Editor screen (slide-left).

Accessibility

Password inputs labeled and announced to screen readers.

Provide clear focus outlines.

3. Wrapped Editor — Shell & Main Controls (central hub)
Purpose

Primary workspace to build the Wrapped. Editor must feel light, fast, and preserve quality with presets.

Overall layout (mobile-first):

Because mobile cannot show left-center-right simultaneously, use a single-column with slide-in panels:

Top bar (fixed):

Left: Close / Back (if user tries to exit show unsaved changes modal)

Center: Wrapped title (editable inline)

Right: Preview icon (eye) + Create (Primary CTA) — Create is prominent and sticky to top-right.

Main canvas area (center): shows the currently selected page in an editable, WYSIWYG-like view

Bottom toolbar (sticky):

Left: Pages button (opens Pages sidebar as sheet)

Middle: Add page (+) (quick add)

Right: Templates / Customize (opens customization sheet)

Slide-in panels:

Pages sheet (left semantics): full-screen sheet from left or bottom; lists pages

Customize sheet (right): bottom sheet with template thumbnails and property controls

Floating Undo/Redo above bottom toolbar (small chips) — optional

Top-level controls & microcopy

Title placeholder: “Untitled Wrapped — tap to rename”

Save status: tiny "Saved" or spinner while saving (auto-save always)

Auto-save: every change saved to DB; show “Saved 12s ago” microcopy.

States

Initial empty page: When new Wrapped created it creates a default Scrapbook page with sample content to reduce writer’s block.

Editing: immediate local update, then auto-save to backend; show small toast or status.

Offline: if offline, mark "Offline — changes will sync when you’re back online." Provide Retry sync button.

Interactions & constraints

Max pages cap: 10 (show soft guidance: “We recommend 3–7 pages for best pacing”).

Quick undo: shake-to-undo? Better: small Undo button.

When trying to leave with unsaved changes (if offline not synced): confirm modal: “You have unsynced changes — save & exit or keep editing”.

4. Pages Sidebar (Add / Reorder / Delete) — Slide-in sheet

Grid of options (2 columns):

Scrapbook — icon + one-liner: “Photos & captions”

Love Coupon — icon + “Promises they can redeem”

Playlist — icon + “A song and a note”

Wrapped Summary — icon + “A highlight reel” (disabled if certain conditions not met; show tooltip)

Each option tap → adds page to end and opens editor for that page with a smooth slide-in animation.

Small details

Provide a tiny sample thumbnail for each template.

If max pages reached: show disabled state + explain the recommendation.

6. Page Editor — Scrapbook Page (center content)
Purpose

On failure → show error overlay: Retry / Remove.

States

Accessibility

Allow alt text for images (optional but encouraged) with hint: “Describe the moment in one line”.

Animations

When moving between images: slight parallax and the butterfly motif flies across from previous to new image (global motif).

Notes

For autoplay: the viewer will ask user to tap to start audio (intro screen). Don’t rely on automatic playback.

Show a short full-screen “Creating your Wrapped…” with subtle animation and progress indicator

Backend tasks:

Ensure all uploads completed and CDN URLs registered

Generate slug (unguessable token)

Set optional expiry (if user chose)

On success → confetti animation then navigate to Sharing Screen

On failure → show error with Retry

Edge cases

Partial upload: wait until all media uploads finish before finalizing; allow "Create anyway" with warning (missing assets).

12. Sharing Screen (the moment of sending)
Purpose

Analytics events

13. Partner Entry — Link click → Password Gate (if enabled)
Purpose

Security + anticipation.

Flow & UX

User taps shared link → open viewer route

If Wrapped password exists:

Show Password Unlock screen (center modal)

Headline: “This Wrapped is private”

Subtext: “Enter the password your partner gave you.”

Password input (with reveal toggle)

CTA: Unlock

Small link: “I didn’t receive a password” — shows gentle help text: “Ask your partner to share it.”

On correct password (server-verified):

Fade out unlock modal → proceed to Intro cinematic screen

On incorrect password:

Shake animation + inline error: “That didn’t match. Try again.” (limit attempts UI? optional: rate-limit)

After 5 failed attempts: show hint modal: “If you forgot the password, request it from the creator.” Optionally allow a request button that sends an email only if the creator opted in (avoid complexity).

If no password:

Proceed directly to Intro cinematic screen

Accessibility

For screen readers, announce the locked state and input focus.

14. Intro Cinematic / Landing Experience (partner first impression)
Purpose

Create cinematic anticipation, request any permissions, and get the partner ready (tap to begin), all while avoiding browser autoplay restrictions.

Layout & content

Fullscreen canvas (video-like)

Elements:

Huge stylized title: “A Wrapped for [Partner Name]”

Subtitle: small tagline (e.g., “A story made just for you”)

Tap-to-begin card (center):

Graphic (butterfly motif)

Small copy: “Tap to begin — turn up your volume for the full effect”

Buttons:

Begin (primary)

Mute (secondary)

Small setting: Request fullscreen? (Only shown after Begin tap as a prompt: “Tap here to view full-screen”)

If background song exists and autoplay will be blocked, show: “Tap to allow audio & cinematic intro.”

Behavior

Tapping Begin:

Request user gesture → play audio, start animation timeline

Optionally trigger browser fullscreen prompt (requestFullscreen) — show small explanation before requesting

Begin cinematic sequence (3–6s): logo → title reveal → butterfly fly with soft particle animation toward first page

If user declines fullscreen or audio, proceed anyway but with a smaller canvas and muted audio

Animations & micro-interactions

Title reveals via cinematic wipes (soft)

Butterfly starts at top-right → arcs toward center, then flies off-screen along the path that becomes the guide between pages

Small haptic feedback on devices that support it when Begin is tapped

Edge cases

If partner has reduced-motion preference: respect it and show simplified, slower animations

If network slow: prerender a tiny intro fallback using local assets

15. Partner Viewer — Page-by-page experience (main viewer)
Purpose

Deliver the emotional story full-screen, with audio, animations, and intuitive navigation.

Layout (fullscreen)

Content area (center): per-page layout (varies by page type)

Top left: Exit/Close (small)

Top right: Music button (play/pause) + Progress (small) + Settings (three-dot for accessibility options)

Bottom center: Navigation controls small:

Prev (left) / Next (right)

Page index: e.g., “2 of 5” (tap to open page list overlay)

When controls hidden (immersive mode), swipe up to show

Page interactions

Swipe left/right to move between pages (pan velocity controlled)

Tap center toggles control chrome

Page auto-advance if creator set durations — show countdown ring on top-right near music controls

Animations: when a page loads:

Image(s) fade in with parallax

Text lines animate (typewriter fade)

Motif (butterfly) arcs across the content and lands on an anchor (e.g., heart icon)

Performance: preload next page assets (lazy but prioritized)

Per-page specifics
Scrapbook page viewer:

Full-bleed image(s) with caption overlay

Swipe inside image carousel if multiple images (small dots)

Tapping image opens zoom modal (pinch to zoom)

Playlist page viewer:

Embedded player UI (Spotify/YouTube embed)

Each coupon with Redeem button (see next section)

Wrapped Summary:

Cinematic montage: small timeline with highlights, stat chips (songs shared, memories), and a final closing message

Small interactions & effects

Each tap produces a micro-animation (ripple, glow)

Page transitions should feel cinematic: small parallax + motion blur (if enabled)

Respect reduced motion: set preference in settings

Accessibility & controls

Provide captions/transcripts for embedded audio where possible

Support for screen readers: pages have roles and labels

High-contrast mode toggle in settings

16. Coupon Redeem Flow (partner action)
Purpose

Let the partner mark a coupon redeemed — emotional micro-moment with animation and server persistence.

UI on coupon card

Redeem button (primary): Redeem (large)

After redeeming, small status badge: Redeemed + timestamp (optional to show)

Creator gets no push under normal conditions (since no accounts), but the redeemed state is recorded, so anyone opening the Wrapped sees it's redeemed.

Flow & animation

Tap Redeem → immediate micro-feedback (ripple)

Confirm modal (optional): “Are you sure? This will mark the coupon as redeemed.” with Confirm / Cancel. For surprise effect you could skip confirmation and just show animation — choose based on desired UX.

Recommendation: show one-tap confirm UI: small undo for 10 seconds.

On confirm:

Send server request to mark redeemed (show spinner on the button)

On success:

Play celebratory animation (burst of hearts + confetti + sound)

Replace button with Redeemed ✓

Show small message: “Enjoy! 🥰”

On failure:

Show inline error: “Couldn’t redeem right now — check your connection.” with Retry

Constraints

Mark coupon redeemed only once; subsequent viewers see redeemed state.

Optionally show who redeemed (if multiple viewers allowed) — but with no auth this is not tracked.

17. Viewer Settings & Controls (small overlay)
Purpose

Layout

Big closing message (creator-provided or default): “I love you — [Creator Name]”

Buttons:

Share reaction (native share sheet)

Replay

Back to beginning

Animation

Slow fade-out with butterfly flying off-screen

Soft soundtrack ending

19. Error / Edge State Screens
